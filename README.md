Attempting to play around with containerizing basic application.

Also playing around with Travis CI.

Currently this is just a containerized React front end and an Nginx container to serve it in production.

I'd like to eventually add a dotnet core back end, and set Nginx to run as a reverse proxy for api request, but to serve static assests
